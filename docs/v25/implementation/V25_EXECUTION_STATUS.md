# V25 S-Tier Program — Execution Status

**Program state:** PLANNING COMPLETE — awaiting owner approval (master plan §16). No implementation started.

## Branch / worktree registry

| Path | Branch | Base SHA | Purpose | Owner | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| /private/tmp/cf-v25-s-tier-plan | plan/v25-s-tier-implementation | 97b78bf71 | Planning artifacts; primary recovery worktree after approval | orchestrator | ACTIVE (planning) |
| /private/tmp/ChapterFlow-books-v25-live | feat/v25-pipeline-live | (moving) | Other session's active campaign worktree | other session | DO NOT TOUCH |
| /private/tmp/ChapterFlow-books-v25-recovery | recovery/v25-pipeline-repair | 97b78bf71 | Other session | other session | DO NOT TOUCH |
| ~/ChapterFlow-books | feat/v25-pipeline | 96ba28179 | Owner's active checkout | owner | DO NOT TOUCH |

Integration SHAs will be appended per gate (G1–G8) after approval.

## Work-package status

All 42 packages: **not started** (see master plan §7 for the index). Status values: not started · in progress · blocked · implementation complete · red-team failed · verification complete · integrated · accepted.

## Conventions (binding)

1. **Result docs commit with their run** — a commit whose subject claims an executed run must contain that run's result doc and state artifacts (prevents V25-06 recurrence).
2. **Unified ledger** — every model call (codex exec AND Claude-side) appends {stage, role, model, effort, latency_ms, outcome} to the per-run ledger; per-book rollup at run end (WP-503 implements; convention applies to ALL program phases including the bakeoff).
3. **Dispatch rows** — no WP is dispatched without a registry row here (branch, base SHA, assigned model); no WP is accepted without independent verification evidence linked here.
4. **Re-fetch before every integration gate**; base-change assessment recorded below.

## Base-change log

| Date | Event | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-16 | Planning base fixed at 97b78bf71 (v6 ruling). Live branch may advance (v6 execution) during approval window. | Re-fetch at Phase-1 entry; if feat/v25-pipeline-live advanced, rebase plan branch or record divergence rationale before first dispatch. |
